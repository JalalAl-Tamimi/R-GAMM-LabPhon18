This includes a step by step tutorial analyses of ultrasound tongue imaging data presented for the workshop [New Developments in Speech Sensing and Imaging](http://labphon16.labphon.org/se-04.html) held in Lisbon as a Satellite wrkshop to LabPhon 18. The code for the tutorial is [available here](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-GAMM-LabPhon18/GAMMsLabPhon.nb.html). 
It is now updated to include the two datasets used for the [demo linear vs GAMs](https://github.com/JalalAl-Tamimi/R-GAMM-LabPhon18/blob/master/dataProd_duud.csv) and then the [actual dataset for running GAMs](https://github.com/JalalAl-Tamimi/R-GAMM-LabPhon18/blob/master/resultsFull.c_NoRelNoz.csv). A couple of line codes are updated as well.
